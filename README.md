# Petals Chat

A chat [web app](http://chat.petals.ml) + HTTP and WebSocket endpoints for BLOOM inference with the [Petals](https://petals.ml) client

## Interactive Chat

You can try it out [here](http://chat.petals.ml) or host the backend on your servers using these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/borzunov/petals-chat.git
cd petals-chat
pip install -r requirements.txt
gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --threads 10 --timeout 900
```

> **Note:** It is important to use `--threads` (not `--workers`), so reusing inference sessions works correctly.

The chat uses the WebSocket API under the hood.

## APIs

The backend provides two APIs endpoints:

- [WebSocket API](#websocket-api-apiv2generate) (`/api/v2/generate`, recommended)
- [HTTP API](#http-api-apiv1) (`/api/v1/...`)

Please use the WebSocket API when possible - it is much faster, more powerful, and consumes less resources.

If you develop your own web app, you can use our endpoint at `http://chat.petals.ml/api/...` for research and development, then set up your own backend for production using the commands above.

> **Note:** We do not recommend using the endpoint at `http://chat.petals.ml/api/...` in production. It has a limited throughput, and we may pause or stop it any time.

### Backend's system requirements

- For the generation speed of 1-2 sec/token, you need one of the following:
    - A GPU server with 10+ GB GPU VRAM
    - A CPU-only server with 20+ GB RAM (in this case, set `TORCH_DTYPE=torch.float32` in [config.py](config.py))
    - A CPU-only server with 10+ GB RAM and AVX512 support
        - Present on late Intel Xeon CPUs, e.g., on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplets with a dedicated CPU
    - In future, we may implement using [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for generation.
        This would allow to use any CPU-only server with 8+ GB RAM for fast **approximate** greedy and top-k generation.

- For the generation speed of 3-4 sec/token, you need:
    - A CPU-only server with 10+ GB RAM

## WebSocket API (`/api/v2/generate`)

This API implies that you open a WebSocket connection and exchange JSON-encoded requests and responses.
This may be done from any programming language, see the example on Javascript:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://${location.host}/api/v2/generate`);
ws.onopen = () => {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: "open_inference_session", max_length: 1024}));
    ws.onmessage = event => {
        const response = JSON.parse(event.data);
        // TODO: Your code here
    };
};
```

The requests must follow this protocol:

### open_inference_session

The first request must be of type **open_inference_session** and include the `max_length` parameter (int).

The inference session created by this request is unique to this WebSocket connection and cannot be reused in other connections.
It is closed automatically when the connection is closed.

Request:

```javascript
{type: "open_inference_session", max_length: 1024}
```

Response:

```javascript
{ok: true}  // If successful
{ok: false, traceback: "..."}  // If failed
```

### generate

The next requests must be of type **generate** and include the same parameters as in the [/api/v1/generate HTTP API](#post-apiv1generate), except for `session_id` (it's identified by the connection you use in the WebSocket API).

A new feature of the WebSocket API is the `stop_sequence` parameter (str). If you set it, the server will continue generation with the same parameters unless it generates the `stop_sequence`, so you may get multiple responses without having to send the request again and wait for the round trip's latency.

Intermediate responses contain the field `stop: false`, and the last response contains `stop: true`. For example, you can set `max_new_tokens: 1` and receive tokens one by one, as soon as they are generated. Check out the chat's [frontend code](static/chat.js) for a detailed example of how to do that.

Request:

```javascript
{type: "generate", "inputs": "A cat in French is \"", "max_new_tokens": 3}
```

Response (one or multiple):

```javascript
{ok: true, outputs: "chat\".", stop: true}  // If successful
{ok: false, traceback: "..."}  // If failed
```

## HTTP API (`/api/v1/...`)

### POST /api/v1/generate

Parameters:

- **inputs** (optional) - New user inputs. May be omitted if you continue generation in an inference session (see below).
- **do_sample** (optional) - If `0` (default), runs greedy generation. If `1`, performs sampling with parameters below.
- **temperature** (optional)
- **top_k** (optional)
- **top_p** (optional)
- **max_length** - Max length of generated text (including prefix) in tokens.
- **max_new_tokens** - Max number of newly generated tokens (excluding prefix).
- **session_id** (optional) - UUID of an inference session opened earlier (see methods below). This allows you to continue generation later without processing prefix from scratch.

Notes:

- You need to specify either `max_length` or `max_new_tokens`.
- If you'd like to solve downstream tasks in the zero-shot mode, start with `do_sample=0` (default).
- If you'd like to make a chat bot or write a long text, start with `do_sample=1, temperature=0.75, top_p=0.9` (tuning these params may help).

Returns (JSON):

- **ok** (bool)
- **outputs** (str)
- **traceback** (str) - the Python traceback if `ok == False`

### GET /api/v1/open_inference_session

Parameters:

- **max_length** (required)

Returns (JSON):

- **ok** (bool)
- **session_id** (str) - UUID of the opened session
- **traceback** (str) - the Python traceback if `ok == False`

### GET /api/v1/close_inference_session

Parameters:

- **session_id** (required)

Returns (JSON):

- **ok** (bool)
- **traceback** (str) - the Python traceback if `ok == False`
